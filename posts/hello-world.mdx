                      _Why You Should Learn Jenkins Before Mastering Other CI CD Tools?_


Commonly referred to as CI/CD, Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery are processes that promise to reliably expedite the delivery of software-as-a-product by helping enterprises become more agile. CI/CD automates the software development process, slashing the delivery time from months and weeks to days and hours.

Although spoken of in the same breath, Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery are two distinct phases in the software development lifecycle. So, before we explore in-depth the 10 best CI CD tools to learn in 2023, let's first get a brief idea of what CI CD is.

## Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) (What Is CI/CD?)

CI/CD can bring about a positive impact on a company's bottom line. For this reason, it is increasingly becoming a mainstream agile practice, being widely adopted by organizations across the globe.

## Continuous Integration

Continuous Integration involves the process of constant code integration into codebase. The aim is to frequently make small integrations, as minor code changes can produce fewer unwanted results. All integrations are checked for errors via build automation, with no human intervention.

Continuous Integration heavily relies on diverse automation tools, including CI servers and code-management systems, to speed up the development, testing, and packaging of software products. It enables early detection and elimination of problems, which greatly mitigates integration issues. Constant code integration also fosters collaboration among teams, allowing developers to quickly deliver high-quality software


## Continuous Delivery
Continuous Delivery (CD) is the methodology of deploying small and frequent software changes, such as bug fixes, UI enhancements, and feature improvements. Basically, Continuous Delivery starts where CI ends. In essence, CD includes staging, testing, and the deployment of Continuous Integration code. While CI falls under developer practices, CD belongs entirely to the realm of operations.

There are numerous advantages to introducing incremental changes, as they are less disruptive compared to releasing a big software upgrade in one go. Implementing continuous, minor changes not only makes troubleshooting and rollback easier, but it also allows for the rapid addition of new features to meet customer demands.

Similar to Continuous Integration, CD relies on automated regression, testing, and performance monitoring to identify errors and security vulnerabilities when software traverses the CD/CI pipeline. With both Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery, fewer changes enable more precise and targeted tests, ensuring the speedy delivery of top-quality code to end-users.


# 10 Best CI CD Tools to Learn in 2023

With the growing adoption of agile practices, several CI CD tools have hit the market in the past few years.
