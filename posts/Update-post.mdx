## GIT COMMAND YOU SHOULD KNOW

1 Git clone
Git clone is a command for downloading existing source code from a remote repository (like Github, for example). In other words, Git clone basically makes an identical copy of the latest version of a project in a repository and saves it to your computer.

_There are a couple of ways to download the source code, but mostly I prefer the clone with https way:_ 

Inline 'code'

```
git clone <https://name-of-the-repository-link>
```
