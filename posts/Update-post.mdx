## GIT COMMAND YOU SHOULD KNOW

1 **Git clone**
Git clone is a command for downloading existing source code from a remote repository (like Github, for example). In other words, Git clone basically makes an identical copy of the latest version of a project in a repository and saves it to your computer.

_There are a couple of ways to download the source code, but mostly I prefer the clone with https way:_ 



2 **Git branch**

Branches are highly important in the git world. By using branches, several developers are able to work in parallel on the same project simultaneously. We can use the git branch command for creating, listing and deleting branches.
